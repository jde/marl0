# 📸 Project Snapshot — Marl0 AI Infrastructure  
**Date:** 2025-04-08  
**Author:** Me

## 🎯 Project State

- Infrastructure stack is fully operational.
- Local development and server environments are cleanly separated and validated.
- Makefile provides ergonomic workflows for build, run, logs, and service management.
- Data directories are tracked in Git (`.gitkeep` method), and validation ensures production safety.
- Multi-service orchestration is successful (Kafka, Redis, Postgres, Memgraph, LanceDB, MinIO, Prometheus, Grafana).
- Observability stack is initialized, Prometheus config is stubbed for future expansion.
- README and CONTRIBUTING are fully up to date and reflect current architecture accurately.
- Changelog initialized (`CHANGELOG.md`) for future tracking.

## 🧭 Current Position

✅ Application services are scaffolded, environment ready for coding.  
✅ Infrastructure questions have been resolved.  
✅ Developer fully understands all infra choices and flows.

**Next action:** Begin application-level development.

## 🔮 Next Steps (Defined but not urgent)

- Wire Kafka producers and consumers.
- Begin data ingestion and processing pipeline.
- Extend observability (Prometheus exporters, Grafana dashboards).
- Implement first data flow into Memgraph.
- Consider RAG system integration later in pipeline.
- Leave narrative/storytelling (LinkedIn or public-facing announcements) for later, when app logic evolves.

## 🧩 Notes

- Project favors **explicit patterns** over hidden automation for maintainability.
- `.env.dev` and `.env.prod` give flexible environment control.
- Production environment is intentionally strict on validations.
- Commit discipline can improve slightly (recommend checkpoint commits at milestones in future cycles).
- Personal style preference: maintain a quiet, clean flow over premature external sharing.

## 📝 Status: ✅ Infra Complete — Ready for Application Development
